# Introduction

Purpose of this assignmet is to investigate and compare the performance of five different machine
learning techniques such as K-Neirest Naighbour, Desicion Trees, Boosted Desision Trees, Support Vector
Machines and Artificial Neural Networks, when applied to two distinct classification problems(distinct datasets).
In order to fullfil the requirement, "Lending Club Dataset" from Kaggle and Adult Dataset from UCI machine
leraning repository are used.  



## Lending Club Dataset

Lending Club is the worldâ€™s largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. Provided dataset
contain complete loan data for all loans issued through 2007 to 2015, including the current loan status(Current,
Late, Fully Paid, etc.). In this problem, we are suppose to predicte if customer is goint to pay or default on
their loan based on provided set of features with labels. Instances with "Current" loan status are discarded to
make it simple binary classification problem with two labels(unpaid,paid). After cleaning and feature
extraction, the dataset contains 15 features and 285373 samples. Fraction(20%) of this data is used for training
in order to reduce computation time, and 10% is kept for testing. 


## Adult Dataset

The adult dataset contains census information from 1994. Our taske is to predict whether a person makes more
than $50K/year. After preprocessing is applied, there are 11 features and 45000 remaining instances. The target 
feature "income" is labeled as "high" when income is greater than $50K and "low" when it is less.
