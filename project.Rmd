# Introduction

Purpose of this assignmet is to investigate and compare the peredictive strength of five different machine
learning techniques such as K-Neirest Naighbour, Desicion Trees, Boosted Desision Trees, Support Vector
Machines and Artificial Neural Networks when applied to two distinct classification problems(distinct datasets).
In order to fullfil the requirement, "Lending Club Dataset" from Kaggle and Adult Dataset from UCI machine leraning
repository is utilized. 
discover the features that are indicative	of	
someone	paying or defaulting on their loan

## Lending Club Dataset

Lending Club is the worldâ€™s largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. It is transforming the
banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding. Provided dataset contain complete loan
data for all loans issued through 2007 to 2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.)
and latest payment information. 


## Adult Dataset


The adult data set has over 22000 instances and 14 features of mostly cate-
gorical variables. I did some preprocessing of the original data by discarding
couple of repeated attributes and clean the categorical values by giving good
names. We see from the table 1 that the binary classes are imbalanced. So, in
addition to Accuracy metric, ROC metric is also needed for this data set
when we compare and contrast different algorithms.
