## Machine Learning 1st Assignment

All codes for different models and data sets are put in different files and
made name specific. Please use prepared shell script in order to run everything
given already cleaned data. To start from original data, one has to download them
and put in "data" folder, then uncomment 2 lines in a 3rd step in the bash script
provied. Also, one needs to install all necessary R packages, otherwise codes will
not run. Everything else is straight forward.
